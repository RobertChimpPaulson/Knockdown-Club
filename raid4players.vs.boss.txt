Event Concept: Raid — 4 Space Monkeys vs Boss Pepe

Overview:
This is a Telegram-based event concept designed for the Knockdown Club game. In this raid, four players (Space Monkeys) team up in a turn-based combat system to battle a single powerful boss — an oversized, meme-powered version of Pepe the Frog.

Boss: "Pepe the Frog"
- Wears a black cloak and a golden crown
- Speaks in sarcastic meme phrases like “Feels bad, monkey” or “You’ll never make it”
- Special attacks include: "Ribbit Rage", "Degen Slam", and "Memecoin Blast"

Gameplay (Mobile Style):
- Players appear as four avatars at the bottom of the screen.
- Each monkey attacks once per round — their damage depends on NFT gloves and equipped items.
- The boss reacts after each attack with animations and taunts.
- Boss has multiple phases (more damage, more sarcasm).
- UI includes health bars for all monkeys and the boss, as well as a “combo meter”.

Winning:
- If the team defeats Pepe, a reward screen appears.
- All participants get loot: NFTs, fight points, or event-only gear.
- A special NFT title: “Pepe Slayer” is awarded to MVP.

Visual Style:
- Retro 16-bit pixel art
- Arena: underground gym/cyberpunk warehouse
- Sega/Dendy arcade game aesthetic
- Flashy visual FX and impact animations

Purpose:
- Fun community-driven event
- A reason to form squads
- A use-case for cosmetic and stat-boosting NFTs
- A callback to Web3 meme culture and anti-corporate spirit
